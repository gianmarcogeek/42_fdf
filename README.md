# Fil'e ferru aka FDF
## My first computer graphics project!

This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D land-scape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file passed as a parameter to the program. Here is an example:
```
$> cat 42.fdf
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
```
Each number represents a point in space:
- **X** | The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
- **Y** | The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
- **Z** | The value corresponds to its altitude.

## How to project 3D to points to a 2D display?
To create the isometric projection i have used the semplified formulas:
  
$xâ€² = (x - y) * cos(a);$
$y' = (x + y) * sen(a) - z;$

To (try) undestand this formulas you have to look at Linear Algebra and Trasformations Matrices
